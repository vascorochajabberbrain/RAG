Bot: Hi, I am your Hey Harper virtual assistant, please make questions for me to answer
User: What is the price of the easygoing necklace?
Bot: The price of the Easy Silver necklace is €48, but with the 40% discount, it is €29.

Here are the final comments from the conversation:
Interesting as as to do with the chunks because there was a chunk with specific information about the easygoing, but not the price, and the other chunk had only the easy silver, I do not know why it did not appear an easygoing set chunk with the price but I also made it hard by not saying easygoing set but easygoing necklace
