User: what is your return policy?
Bot: Our return policy allows for returns and exchanges within 30 days of the order delivery date. If the merchandise is defective, you have up to 100 days from delivery to request a return or exchange. It's important to email customer@enroutejewelry.com for authorization before returning any items.

For domestic orders, we provide a return label at no additional cost, making the return process seamless for our customers. However, for international orders, the return or exchange shipping costs are the customer's responsibility.

Refunds will be processed to your original form of payment or as a gift card once we receive the returned item. For domestic orders, refunds typically take 7-10 days after we have received the return.
User: will the jewelry tarnish?
Bot: Our jewelry pieces are 18k gold or platinum plated, designed for longevity. To help prevent tarnishing, we recommend avoiding contact with water and chemicals like makeup or hair products. Our gold plating is three times thicker than the industry standard for enhanced durability.

If you're looking for tarnish-free options, consider our waterproof jewelry collection for added peace of mind. You can find it here: [Waterproof Jewelry Collection](https://enroutejewelry.com/collections/waterproof-jewelry).
User: How do I find my ring size?
Bot: To determine your ring size, follow these steps:

1. Cut a narrow strip of paper or use a piece of string that can comfortably wrap around your finger.
2. Wrap the paper or string around the finger where you plan to wear the ring, ensuring it fits snugly without being too tight.
3. Mark the spot where the two ends meet around your finger.
4. Lay the paper or string flat against a ruler and measure the distance from the end to the mark you made. This measurement represents the circumference of your finger.
5. Use the ring size chart available in the product description on our product page to find your ring size based on the circumference. If your measurement falls between two sizes, we recommend choosing the larger size for a more comfortable fit.

The size chart can be found on the product description page for rings.
