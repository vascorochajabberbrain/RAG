User: but I cannot choose what I get?

Bot: With the Hey Harper monthly subscription, each piece of jewelry you receive is chosen as a surprise by the design team. This means you won't be able to select the specific items you get, as the idea is to enjoy a curated and unexpected addition to your jewelry collection each month.

User: Hm.. I thought I could choose between different styles

Bot: With the Hey Harper subscription, the focus is on providing a monthly surprise piece of jewelry. This means that the specific piece you receive each month is curated by the design team and is a surprise, rather than being selected by you. If you're looking for more control over the styles you receive, you might want to explore other purchasing options where you can directly choose your favorite pieces from their collection.

Here are the final comments from the conversation:
At the end it was already inventing about the exclusive pieces, I wanted him to tell me that I can choose between 3 different regimes but it didn't retrieve that information... I will increase the number of chunks to 6, here as the chunks are so small shouldn't be a problem
