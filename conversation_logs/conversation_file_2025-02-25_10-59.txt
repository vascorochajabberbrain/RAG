Bot: Hi, I am your Hey Harper virtual assistant, please make questions for me to answer
User: how much does it cost the nassau necklace?
Bot: The Nassau Necklace costs €48, and there is currently a 40% discount available, bringing the price down to €29.
User: how can I get that discount?
Bot: You can get the 40% discount on the Nassau Necklace by taking advantage of the current promotion that offers this discount when purchasing three items. Alternatively, there is an ongoing offer of saving 25% when you buy two items.
User: alright, then i need a bracelet and a ring to pair it, what is the color of the necklace?
Bot: The Nassau Necklace is coated with 14K gold, giving it a durable, waterproof, golden color. It would pair well with a bracelet and ring in a similar gold tone.
User: can you suggest some?
Bot: Certainly! To pair with the Nassau Necklace, which has a 14K gold color, you might consider the following options:

1. **Nassau Bracelet**: This bracelet matches the necklace with its 14K gold PVD coating, making it a perfect complement. It is priced at €44, with a discount available.

2. **Rachel Bracelet**: Another option is the Rachel Bracelet, which also comes with a durable gold tone.

3. **Charlie Ring**: This ring is priced at €44 but is currently available at a discounted rate.

These pieces will complement the golden tone of the Nassau Necklace beautifully.
User: alright, I want the nassau bracelet and that ring
Bot: Great choice! The Nassau Bracelet is available with a 14K gold PVD coating, matching the Nassau Necklace perfectly. The bracelet is priced at €44, and you can get it for €27 with the 40% discount.

Additionally, the Charlie Ring, which you've chosen, is also a lovely complement to these pieces. It is priced at €44, and it may also be available with a discount.

You can add these items to your cart and apply any relevant discounts upon checkout.
User: yes, I want to do that, how much would it be all together?
Bot: With the Nassau Necklace, Nassau Bracelet, and Charlie Ring all chosen and taking into account the 40% discount applicable when purchasing three items, here is the breakdown:

- Nassau Necklace: Originally €48, now €29 with the 40% discount.
- Nassau Bracelet: Originally €44, now €27 with the 40% discount.
- Charlie Ring: Originally €44, now €27 with the 40% discount.

Altogether, the total would be approximately **€83** after applying the discount to each item.
User: cool! tahnks
Bot: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Enjoy your shopping at Hey Harper!
