User: I want to know more about the product subscription

Bot: Hey Harper offers a monthly surprise jewelry subscription that allows you to receive a unique jewelry piece each month. Here are some details about the subscription:

1. **Cost and Savings**: The subscription costs $30 per month, and by subscribing, you save 50% off the regular price. You can choose to pay monthly, and there's the flexibility to cancel or pause the subscription anytime without any commitments or additional costs.

2. **Shipping**: For monthly paying subscribers, the jewelry pieces are shipped monthly on the same date as the first order to the given address. If you opt for a prepaid subscription, the pieces will be shipped in the first week of each month.

3. **Jewelry Selection**: Each jewelry piece is selected by Hey Harperâ€™s design team and may include items from the core collection or upcoming new drops. The jewelry is made from stainless steel with a 14K gold PVD coating, ensuring they are durable and waterproof.

4. **Warranty**: Hey Harper offers a lifetime color warranty for their jewelry. If your jewelry loses color, you can contact customer support with a visible picture of your item to claim the warranty.
