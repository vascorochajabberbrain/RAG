Bot: Hi, I am your Hey Harper virtual assistant, please make questions for me to answer
User: how much is the nassau
Bot: The Nassau Necklace is priced at €48, but it's currently available for €29 with a 40% discount. Would you like to know more about it or add it to your cart?
User: how can i get the discount?
Bot: You can get the discount by purchasing multiple items! If you buy 2 items, you'll receive a 25% discount, and if you buy 3 or more items, you'll get a 40% discount on your total purchase. Just add the items to your cart, and the discounts will be applied at checkout. Would you like help with anything specific?
User: alright, then I need a bracelet and ring to mach with it, any suggestion?
Bot: For a stylish match with the Nassau Necklace, I recommend the following:

1. **Nassau Bracelet** - Priced at €44, available for €27 with a 40% discount. It's a beautiful complement to the necklace.
   
2. **Charlie Ring** - Priced at €44, available for €27 with a 40% discount. Its elegant design will pair well with the Nassau Necklace.

Both of these pieces will complete your look beautifully! Would you like to add them to your cart?
User: cool can be, are they all the same color?
Bot: Yes, the Nassau Necklace, Nassau Bracelet, and Charlie Ring are all crafted from stainless steel and coated with a durable 14K gold PVD finish, giving them a consistent gold color. This ensures a coordinated look when worn together. Would you like to add them to your cart or need assistance with anything else?
User: super, how much it will be all?
Bot: Here's the breakdown for your order:

1. **Nassau Necklace**: €29 (with 40% Off)
2. **Nassau Bracelet**: €27 (with 40% Off)
3. **Charlie Ring**: €27 (with 40% Off)

Total before any additional discounts: €83

Since you're buying 3 items, you'll get a 40% discount on the total. 

**Discount amount**: €83 x 40% = €33.20

**Total after discount**: €83 - €33.20 = €49.80

So, the total for all three items will be **€49.80**. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?
User: that is wrong, the prices you used were already with the discount, the price will be 83
Bot: I apologize for the confusion! You're correct. The prices for the items without the discount are:

1. **Nassau Necklace**: €48
2. **Nassau Bracelet**: €44
3. **Charlie Ring**: €44

Total without any discounts: €48 + €44 + €44 = **€136**.

Since you're buying 3 items, you'll receive a 40% discount off the total:

**Discount amount**: €136 x 40% = €54.40

**Total after discount**: €136 - €54.40 = **€81.60**.

Thank you for your understanding, and would you like to proceed with this order?
User: no worries, thank you
Bot: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask. Happy shopping!
