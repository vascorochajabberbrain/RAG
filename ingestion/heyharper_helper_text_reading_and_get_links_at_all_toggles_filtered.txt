Go back and enter each email address one at a time, clicking ‘send’ after each one rather than uploading them all at once.
Another possible scenario is that the friend you’re trying to invite is already a customer with us, therefore isn’t eligible for the first-order discount. The referral discount is only valid for first-time customers.
If you are still having problems using the email referrals we recommend using your unique referral link or sharing the referral through Facebook, Twitter, or Messenger to receive credit. Please contact info@heyharper.com if you need further assistance.
Referred friends must be first-time customers in order for both of you to receive the referral rewards. In addition, the referral must be initiated through the use of your unique referral link. Points will be added to your account as soon as your friend completes their first purchase on our website. When this happens you will receive an email letting you know that one of your referrals made a purchase using your code and that a reward was added to your account. You can also check your ‘Rewards History’ to see a list of any points that you have received for referrals.
Review points are awarded only to verified buyer reviews, meaning you must have purchased the product you are trying to review and you have received a review request email from us. We cannot award points if you tried adding a review to a product that isn't part of your order history.

At Hey Harper we want to empower your bold self-expression, with pieces as unique as you are!

Crafted from resilient stainless steel and fortified by a 10x stronger PVD coating, our jewelry is your lifetime companion – enduring sweat, showers, and even beach days without losing its color.

After an exhaustive material research to guarantee the high resistance levels, some surveys to evaluate accurate customer feedback and countless extreme tests, we decided offering lifetime color warranty.  
We stand by this!  
We're not just promising waterproof, we're delivering it.  
Claiming that our jewelry is waterproof is not for the sake of marketing purposes - we actually mean it!

If your Hey Harper jewelry does not live up to the expectation, kindly email our customer support with a well visible picture of your discolored item, and we'll take care of the issue.

Waterproof, how?  
Shop now  
How is our jewelry waterproof?  
Hey Harper was born on the dream of having quality long-lasting jewelry that wouldn’t make our pockets go slimmer. Our pieces are crafted from resilient stainless steel and fortified by a 10x stronger coating process named PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition) to make our jewelry your lifetime companion. Our pieces endure sweat, showers, and beach days without losing its color.  
But what is Stainless Steel?  
Stainless steel is a strong and durable metal that possesses a passive layer of chromium oxide, which shields it from corrosion and even repairs minor scratches on its own. In this manner, it won't rust or tarnish and can last a very long time without needing to be replaced or broken.  
What is the 10x stronger coating process?  
It is the Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD), one of the most modern coating process which ensures that the color lasts longer. PVD is more than a bath of gold, PVD uses physical reactions to change the liquid source material to gold. Compared to gold or silver plating, PVD is a vastly different coating procedure. There is no way to avoid the color fading on plated jewelry, it will happen sooner or later but with our coating process you don't have that worry. This coating is what makes our pieces daily-life resistant. You can take a shower, put lotion on, live your life to the fullest, the color won't fade! We stand by this! We're not just promising waterproof, we're delivering it. In fact, we believe in our long-lasting quality so much that we offer you a lifetime color warranty.

Claiming that our jewelry is waterproof is not for the sake of marketing purposes - we actually mean it! If your Hey Harper jewelry does not live up to the expectation, kindly email our customer support with a well visible picture of your discolored item, and we'll take care of the issue!zerPackaging
