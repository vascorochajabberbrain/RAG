All points are valid for 12 months, after which they expire and may no longer be redeemed.
2. How to Redeem Points
To redeem points, the Customer must be logged in our Site with the email used during registration in the Loyalty Rewards Program. It is not possible to combine points, rewards or offers from various accounts, even if the account holder name is the same Customer.
You can redeem your points during checkout, before finalizing the order, by clicking the dropdown menu bar to select the number of points you would like to redeem on the order.
A minimum balance of at least 100 points ($10) is necessary each time the Customer wants to make a redemption. Points can be redeemed in increments of 100 points ($10).
If you were not logged in when placing an order, you may contact us at info@heyharpershop.com to help apply your points to your Loyalty Rewards Program account. If you’re a returning Customer and you did a guest checkout by mistake but used the same email address associated with your Loyalty Rewards Program account, you will still earn points for that purchase.
3. Points Balance in Case of Returns
Any points you earn on a purchase that you later return will be deducted from your point balance.
If you used your reward points to place an order and are returning the entire order, we will refund you the total dollar amount spent after the discount was applied. The points you redeemed will also be added back to your Loyalty Rewards Program account. New points earned from the refunded purchase will be removed from your Loyalty Rewards Program account.

Double-check that you were signed into your rewards account and didn’t accidentally check out as a guest. You must be logged in when making purchases to earn points. If you have done this in error, contact us at info@heyharper.com to help apply your points to your account. If you’re a returning customer and you did a guest checkout by mistake, but used the same email address associated with your rewards account, you will still earn points for that purchase.
You also won’t receive points if you return your full purchase or your purchase is canceled for any reason. Please note that any points you earn on a purchase you later return will be deducted from your point balance.
We are sorry to hear that. There are a couple of scenarios that could have triggered the error message.
Privacy PolicyProudly European: 100% Tariff-Free
The first possible scenario is that there was a mistype in one of the email addresses that you entered or you forgot to put commas between multiple emails to separate them. Go back and enter each email address one at a time, clicking ‘send’ after each one rather than uploading them all at once.
Another possible scenario is that the friend you’re trying to invite is already a customer with us, therefore isn’t eligible for the first-order discount. The referral discount is only valid for first-time customers.
If you are still having problems using the email referrals we recommend using your unique referral link or sharing the referral through Facebook, Twitter, or Messenger to receive credit. Please contact info@heyharper.com if you need further assistance.
Referred friends must be first-time customers in order for both of you to receive the referral rewards. In addition, the referral must be initiated through the use of your unique referral link. Points will be added to your account as soon as your friend completes their first purchase on our website.When this happens you will receive an email letting you know that one of your referrals made a purchase using your code and that a reward was added to your account. You can also check your ‘Rewards History’ to see a list of any points that you have received for referrals.
Review points are awarded only to verified buyer reviews, meaning you must have purchased the product you are trying to review and you have received a review request email from us. We cannot award points if you tried adding a review to a product that isn't part of your order history.
Privacy PolicyAnother important thing to note is that there is a 4 day delay between reviews rewards, meaning if you try to review multiple products at once you will only receive points for 1 product. A minimum of 4 days time must pass between your reviews in order for you to receive reward points for each of them.Another important thing to note is that there is a 4 day delay between reviews rewards, meaning if you try to review multiple products at once you will only receive points for 1 product.

If you enter a birthday that's within the next 30 days, your reward will be delayed until 30 days from the date of entry.
Your birthday code is non-transferable and may not be sold or assigned to anyone else. If we feel someone is trying to manipulate the program, we reserve the right to terminate your account at our discretion.
If you used your reward points to place an order and are returning the entire order, we will refund you the total dollar amount spent after the discount was applied. The points you redeemed will also be added back to your rewards account, however any new points earned from the now refunded purchase will be removed from your rewards account.Proudly European: 100% Tariff-Free
If you used your reward points to place an order and are returning only a part of your order, we will refund you the total dollar amount for the product(s) you are returning, but the reward points that you redeemed for that order will not be added back to your rewards account. The number of new points earned will equal the dollar amount left after the partial refund (if you spent $100 and were refunded $80, you will earn 20 points).
Your points will expire within one (12 month) calendar year. To collect and redeem points, be sure you are shopping with the same account and email each time. We will not be able to combine points, rewards or offers from various accounts, even if it is the same account holder name

If you have done this in error, contact us at info@heyharper.com to help apply your points to your account. If you’re a returning customer and you did a guest checkout by mistake, but used the same email address associated with your rewards account, you will still earn points for that purchase.Proudly European: 100% Tariff-Free
You also won’t receive points if you return your full purchase or your purchase is canceled for any reason. Please note that any points you earn on a purchase you later return will be deducted from your point balance.
We are sorry to hear that. There are a couple of scenarios that could have triggered the error message.
Privacy PolicyProudly European: 100% Tariff-Free
The first possible scenario is that there was a mistype in one of the email addresses that you entered or you forgot to put commas between multiple emails to separate them. Go back and enter each email address one at a time, clicking ‘send’ after each one rather than uploading them all at once.
Another possible scenario is that the friend you’re trying to invite is already a customer with us, therefore isn’t eligible for the first-order discount. The referral discount is only valid for first-time customers.
If you are still having problems using the email referrals we recommend using your unique referral link or sharing the referral through Facebook, Twitter, or Messenger to receive credit. Please contact info@heyharper.com if you need further assistance.
Referred friends must be first-time customers in order for both of you to receive the referral rewards. In addition, the referral must be initiated through the use of your unique referral link. Points will be added to your account as soon as your friend completes their first purchase on our website.Proudly European: 100% Tariff-Free
When this happens you will receive an email letting you know that one of your referrals made a purchase using your code and that a reward was added to your account. You can also check your ‘Rewards History’ to see a list of any points that you have received for referrals.
Review points are awarded only to verified buyer reviews, meaning you must have purchased the product you are trying to review and you have received a review request email from us. We cannot award points if you tried adding a review to a product that isn't part of your order history.
Privacy PolicyAnother important thing to note is that there is a 4 day delay between reviews rewards, meaning if you try to review multiple products at once you will only receive points for 1 product. A minimum of 4 days time must pass between your reviews in order for you to receive reward points for each of them.
A pre-order allows you to reserve a product before it is officially available for sale. By pre-ordering, you secure your piece from a limited production run, ensuring that you receive one of the 200 exclusive necklaces our team has crafted.Lucky you: We’re offering an exclusive pre-order discount on the full price for early bird shoppers, including the cost of shipping. This discount will decrease randomly, so the sooner you buy, the more you save. Don’t wait — buy now or cry later. When ordering, the price displayed is the amount you pay to reserve and receive your piece. No further charges or payments are required.

Claiming that our jewelry is waterproof is not for the sake of marketing purposes - we actually mean it!

Waterproof, how?

How is our jewelry waterproof?
Hey Harper was born on the dream of having quality long-lasting jewelry that wouldn’t make our pockets go slimmer. Our pieces are crafted from resilient stainless steel and fortified by a 10x stronger coating process named PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition) to make our jewelry your lifetime companion. Our pieces endure sweat, showers, and beach days without losing its color.
But what is Stainless Steel?
Stainless steel is a strong and durable metal that possesses a passive layer of chromium oxide, which shields it from corrosion and even repairs minor scratches on its own. In this manner, it won't rust or tarnish and can last a very long time without needing to be replaced or broken.
What is the 10x stronger coating process?
It is the Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD), one of the most modern coating process which ensures that the color lasts longer. PVD is more than a bath of gold, PVD uses physical reactions to change the liquid source material to gold. Compared to gold or silver plating, PVD is a vastly different coating procedure. There is no way to avoid the color fading on plated jewelry, it will happen sooner or later but with our coating process you don't have that worry.
This coating is what makes our pieces daily-life resistant. You can take a shower, put lotion on, live your life to the fullest, the color won't fade!
We stand by this!
We're not just promising waterproof, we're delivering it. In fact, we believe in our long-lasting quality so much that we offer you a lifetime color warranty.

Claiming that our jewelry is waterproof is not for the sake of marketing purposes - we actually mean it!
If your Hey Harper jewelry does not live up to the expectation, kindly email our customer support with a well visible picture of your discolored item, and we'll take care of the issue!

Transfer of Personal Information
For providing you our Services, we may transfer and share your Personal Information to other entities of Hey Harper’s group and to third parties that may be located in other countries.  Namely, we use service providers and intermediaries, such as companies that provide technological support and electronic payment processing companies, which must have access to some of your Personal Information, including but not limited to purposes of transaction processing and fraud prevention.
However, these transfers are made solely and exclusively for the fulfillment of the purposes for which your Personal Information is collected and in accordance with our instructions, in strict compliance with the regulations on the processing of personal data and information security.

All transfers of your Personal Information to third parties located outside the European Union or the European Economic Area (i.e. to a third country) shall be made ensuring strict compliance with European legislation on the transfer of data to third countries and with  all necessary information, including an indication of the safeguards for such transfer:
• Adequacy decisions: where the European Commission determines that a third country offers an adequate level of data protection, personal data may be sent to that country without implementing any other measures mentioned above;
• Standard contractual clauses: we use standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to organizations outside the EEA. These contractual commitments have been adopted by the European Commission and ensure adequate protection of personal data transferred to countries outside the EEA by binding recipients of personal data to certain data protection standards, including the obligation to implement appropriate technical and security measures;
• Other contractual commitments: comparable to those provided in the standard contractual clauses.
 Storage of Personal Information
