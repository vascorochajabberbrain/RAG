· Through seasonal sales;
· By referring friends;
· By reviewing products purchased by you.

Prices applicable to any products may be changed at any time by Hey Harper. This change will be communicated to the Customer before placing any order. Prices are applicable for any purchase conducted on our Site.
Currently, the Loyalty Rewards Program is exclusive to our Site. Thus, it is not possible to earn or redeem points for purchases made in our physical stores.
All purchases made by the Customer before joining the Loyalty Rewards Program will not be considered for earning points.
All points are valid for 12 months, after which they expire and may no longer be redeemed.
2. How to Redeem Points
To redeem points, the Customer must be logged in our Site with the email used during registration in the Loyalty Rewards Program. It is not possible to combine points, rewards or offers from various accounts, even if the account holder name is the same Customer.
You can redeem your points during checkout, before finalizing the order, by clicking the dropdown menu bar to select the number of points you would like to redeem on the order.
A minimum balance of at least 100 points ($10) is necessary each time the Customer wants to make a redemption. Points can be redeemed in increments of 100 points ($10).
If you were not logged in when placing an order, you may contact us at info@heyharpershop.com to help apply your points to your Loyalty Rewards Program account. If you’re a returning Customer and you did a guest checkout by mistake but used the same email address associated with your Loyalty Rewards Program account, you will still earn points for that purchase.
3. Points Balance in Case of Returns
Any points you earn on a purchase that you later return will be deducted from your point balance.
If you used your reward points to place an order and are returning the entire order, we will refund you the total dollar amount spent after the discount was applied. The points you redeemed will also be added back to your Loyalty Rewards Program account. New points earned from the refunded purchase will be removed from your Loyalty Rewards Program account.
If you used your reward points to place an order and are returning only a part of that order, we will refund you the total dollar amount for the product(s) you are returning, but the reward points that you redeemed for that order will not be added back to your Loyalty Rewards Program account. In this case, the number of new points earned will equal the amount left after the partial refund. For example, if you spent $100 and were refunded $80, you will earn 20 points.
you will not receive any points in case your purchase is canceled for any reason.
4. Other Benefits
If you add your birthday on the Loyalty Rewards Program page, we will send you a discount code to your email, which will be valid for 30 days from the date of your birthday. If, at the time of entering your birthday to your account, your birthday is within 30 days, the discount code reward will be delayed 30 days from the date of entry.
The birthday discount code is non-transferable and must not be sold or assigned to third persons.
5. Friends Referral
You may earn points by referring a friend, if the following conditions are met:
· Referred friends must be first-time customers in order for both of you to receive the referral rewards;
· The referral must be initiated through the use of your unique referral link, sent by Hey Harper.
Points will be added to your Loyalty Rewards Program account as soon as your friend completes their first purchase on our website.
If you referred any friends but did not receive any points for it, please confirm whether all above mentioned requirements are met, check your Rewards History or contact us at info@heyharpershop.com.
6. Review Points
Review points are awarded only to verified buyer reviews. To earn review points, you must have:
· Purchased the product you are trying to review; and
· Received a review request email from Hey Harper.
Points will not be awarded if you tried adding a review to a product that isn't part of your order history.
If you review more than one product at once, you will only receive review points for one product. A minimum of four days must pass between your reviews in order for you to receive reward points for each of them.

At Hey Harper we want to empower your bold self-expression, with pieces as unique as you are!

Crafted from resilient stainless steel and fortified by a 10x stronger PVD coating, our jewelry is your lifetime companion – enduring sweat, showers, and even beach days without losing its color.

After an exhaustive material research to guarantee the high resistance levels, some surveys to evaluate accurate customer feedback and countless extreme tests, we decided offering lifetime color warranty.
We stand by this!
We're not just promising waterproof, we're delivering it.
Claiming that our jewelry is waterproof is not for the sake of marketing purposes - we actually mean it!

If your Hey Harper jewelry does not live up to the expectation, kindly email our customer support with a well visible picture of your discolored item, and we'll take care of the issue.
