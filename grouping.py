                You will receive:
                - A list of groups, where each group is a list of sentences. Each group is identified by a number.
                - A new sentence to insert.
                - A boolean flag indicating whether creating a new group is allowed.

                Your response must be:
                - A list of one of these two options, for each new sentence:
                    - The number of the group where the sentence fits best.
                    - Or `-1` if it fits in none and should form a new group.

                Rules:
                - If no groups exist yet, the only valid answer is `-1`, for the first new sentence.
                - If the boolean is True, you must pick an existing group â€” do not return `-1`.

                Only respond with a number. Examples:
                `3`
                `-1`
